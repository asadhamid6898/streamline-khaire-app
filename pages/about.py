## Our Mission

Khaire Health is dedicated to making advanced health screening accessible through non-invasive retinal image analysis. Our platform uses cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to analyze retinal fundus images and identify early biomarkers of various health conditions.

## The Science Behind Retinal Analysis

The retina is a unique part of the body where blood vessels can be directly observed non-invasively. As an extension of the brain and sharing similar tissue characteristics, the retina provides a window into your overall health.

### Why Retinal Imaging?

- **Non-invasive**: No blood draws or invasive procedures required
- **Cost-effective**: More affordable than many traditional diagnostic tests
- **Early detection**: Can identify disease biomarkers before symptoms appear
- **Multi-condition screening**: A single retinal image can provide insights into multiple health conditions

## Our Technology

Our platform utilizes advanced deep learning models trained on extensive datasets of annotated retinal images.

## Research Foundation

Our technology is built on peer-reviewed research demonstrating correlations between retinal biomarkers and systemic health conditions:

- **Alzheimer's Disease**: Studies have shown that retinal nerve fiber layer thinning and vascular changes can precede cognitive symptoms by several years.

- **Diabetes**: Characteristic changes in retinal blood vessels can be detected before clinical diagnosis of diabetes.

- **Cardiovascular Health**: The arrangement and condition of retinal blood vessels are strongly associated with cardiovascular health status.

- **Neurological Health**: The retina develops from the same tissue as the brain during embryonic development, making it a reliable proxy for assessing neural health.

## Our Team

Khaire Health was founded by a multidisciplinary team of ophthalmologists, neurologists, data scientists, and software engineers committed to making healthcare more accessible and preventative.
