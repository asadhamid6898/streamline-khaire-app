    Recent research has established a strong connection between retinal changes and Alzheimer's disease. The retina is considered an extension of the central nervous system and shares many similarities with brain tissue.
    
    Studies have shown that:
    
    - Thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) correlates with cognitive decline
    - Changes in retinal blood vessel patterns can predict onset of Alzheimer's years before symptoms appear
    - Specific protein deposits similar to those found in the brain can sometimes be detected in the retina
    
    ### Early Detection
    
    Detecting these changes early can help with:
    
    - Earlier intervention with lifestyle modifications
    - Monitoring disease progression
    - Potential enrollment in clinical trials
    - Development of treatment plans

    Diabetes affects small blood vessels throughout the body, with the retina being particularly vulnerable. Changes in retinal vascular health can be detected before other clinical signs of diabetes appear.

    - Elevated blood glucose damages retinal blood vessels
    - Microaneurysms are often the earliest detectable sign of diabetic retinopathy
    - Changes in vessel caliber and tortuosity correlate with diabetes progression
    - Retinal capillary dropout indicates microvascular damage

    The retina contains the only blood vessels that can be directly visualized non-invasively, making it an excellent window into cardiovascular health.

    - Narrowing of arterioles (small arteries)
    - Changes in the arteriole-to-venule ratio (AVR)
    - Arteriovenous nicking where arteries cross over veins
